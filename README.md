Cycle through the first 1000 primes on each button click. 

The code can be cleaned up a ton. I wrote this before I had a firm understanding of CSS, 
but wanted to add something to the JavaScript I was working on so that it was presentable. 

I would love to go back, clean that up, and rewrite the JavaScript so that the button 
click isn't confined to the first 1000 clicks.
